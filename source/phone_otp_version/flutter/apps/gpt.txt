Hello iam flutter developer and nestjs build chat app one to one and group chat iam use mongodb and socket.io
i need to add agora for video and voice calls
since you know agora is just a rtc model for handle the communications between two connected users
there are not handle for start call or pickup screen for a call or ring or accept or cancel the call or end the
call with show the timer of the call
i need to create a model for it in my database and handle all about single call or group call
from my server side and save call logs for each user with all data about the call
and handle group calls and users call please tell me the best way to handle all serious
for the calls with agora sync to my server mongodb and socket in real time like
if i call some one and he already in call the caller should notify and screen close
and for reject the call and end the call all should handle in real time and recorded in the
users log table




i need to implement abstraction for handle various rtc call i can use agora or any rtc provider
so i need to implement it and i should listen to call state and time and peer user data for it
and this controller will have some method like join or exit or emit call timer or state


develop web real time chat app backend
which is good for fast and scalable for build chat apps
socket.io or native websockets ?
do full research about it
